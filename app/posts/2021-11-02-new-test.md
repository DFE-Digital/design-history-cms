# **How a design history has helped**

On the Becoming a teacher team, we’ve been using a design history to document the evolution of the Find postgraduate teacher training and Apply for teacher training services since they began in May 2018.

Our design history is a public record of our designs and it tells the story of what we’ve designed and why:
The value of documenting design

**The design history looks forwards and backwards.**

New posts show the team where the service is going. They highlight what will be researched or built next, and can draw attention to important design points.

Old posts tell us how we got here. With them we can:

```
discover what we did and why
re-evaluate decisions
see how a feature has changed
```
